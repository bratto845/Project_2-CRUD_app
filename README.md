Project 2 FetchMate (CRUD)
-----------------------------------------
FetchMate is an application designed for pet owners. Users can advertise events, connect with other pet owners in the area, search and review local veterinarian offices, pet shops, and dog friendly parks. The idea came about from other helpful pet applications found in Seattle, Washington. While their applications for dog walkers or for meet ups, there is not a one stop shop type of application like FetchMate is attempting to achieve. 

This project is the second project for General Assembly Software Engineering, Immersive Course. We were tasked to create a CRUD system that incorporates everything we have learned in the past six weeks.
